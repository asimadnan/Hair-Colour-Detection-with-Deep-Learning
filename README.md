# Hair-Colour-Detection-with-Deep-Learning

This notebook is for the major project submission for COMP8220, on the image dataset and task. It contains the following sections:

*   Problem Statement
*   A description of the selected conventional ML model;
*   Description of each Deep learning model and choices made
*   Consulusion

For this problem, we are working with the CelebA dataset, a widely used dataset of celebrity faces. The task is to predict the hair colour of the celebrity, which will be one of black, brown, blond or gray.

All data is available in Kaggle at this [URL](https://www.kaggle.com/c/celeba-guess-hair/overview)

For testing, there'll be a public test set and a private test set.
